#### To run the app:
```
npm install
bower install
grunt
```

PS: I am using grunt and bower, so you will need them installed globally.

#### This code is using John Papa's style guide, which I normally use on my projects.

#### Going to add later:
- Unit tests with Karma
- Functional tests with Protractor
- Build a dist folder using Gulp
