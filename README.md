# To-do lab app

Just a simple (and not original) app to play with technologies that I like.
The idea is to create a simple app that I can rewrite and enhance using different technologies.

See? Super original :) But it is still super fun!

# UI implementations:
- AngularJS (done)
- AngularJS 2 with typescript
- AngularJS 2 with ES6
- Ionic 2
- React

# Backend implementations:
- ASP.NET Web API (in development)
- Node.JS
- Firebase

# Other technologies:
- MongoDB
- Azure
- AWS
- Elastic Search

There is another readme in each folder explaing how to run the projects
