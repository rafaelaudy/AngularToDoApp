# To-do lab app

Just a simple (and not original) app to play with technologies that I like.
The idea is to create a simple app that I can rewrite and enhance using different technologies.

The idea is to keep the code simple but following good practices.
I may complicate things a bit to test cool language features.

See? Super original :) But it is still super fun!
