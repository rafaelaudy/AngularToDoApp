# AngularToDoApp

Just a simple (and not original) app to play with technologies that I like.
The idea is to create a simple app that I can rewrite in different technologies.

See? Super original :) But it is still fun!

To run the app just type:
```
npm install
bower install
grunt
```

PS: I am using grunt and bower. So you will need to have in your global NPM packages the grunt-cli and bower.
