#### To run the app:
```
npm install
node .\bin\www.js
```

#### To run the tests:
I am about to fix that ;)
```
mocha .\tests\specs\toDoRouteSpec.js
```

PS: I am using mocha, so you will need it installed globally.

#### Things to add (so I will not forget :p )
- Tests
- Mongoose
- Change start and test commands
- Error handling
- Start multiple threads
- Logs with Kibana
- Add test coverage
